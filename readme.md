This is a simple web app that accepts a class name and a list of property names in a number of different formats, such as

- camelCasePropertyName
- snake\_case\_property\_name
- mixed\_caseProperty\_name
- white space separated property name

and creates a model object with getters and setters for each property.

This is similar to and inspired by Eclipse's builtin getter/setter generation for Java classes.
